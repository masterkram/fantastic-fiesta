of a beach in Spain. They want to be able to inform people about their wonderful beach.

+ A title with the name of the beach.
+ Some bullet points describing:
  + the color and texture of the sand.
  + the color and temperature of the sea.
  + the activities and food that are purchasable nearby.
+ One or more pictures of the beach.
+ The phone number of the manager (`+34 948 324 312`)
